Steps for implementation :
1) Fetch all Salesforce user details from testDomain server -- done
2) Filter users having invalid oauth tokens(tokens which are already marked as invalid in previous iteration)
3) Iterate over each user, get opportunity details
    i) ensure tokens are valid and renew the tokens if they get invalid in the middle of the flow

4) for each closed opportunity get the file details from three sources
5) update analytics to myTestDomain server(for testing write to local database)
